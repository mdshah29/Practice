Maths:

1. Linear Algebra 

matrix, vectors 

2. Calculus 

Derivatives , Integrations 




Target Variable/ Dependent Variable   = y == loan status    x1,x2,x3

Independent   ==  Income, cibil, company 

y = f(x1,x2,x3,.......)

loan status = f(Income, cibil, company)     --> based on this we will get like person will repay loan or not 

where f -> functional form 
where functional form can be in Linear, Quadratic, or polynomial etc 



=>    Linear Equations:

y = dep (sales)

x = independent(discount)

scatter plot helps us to visulize corelations 



y = mx + c

y(sales) = 200(disc) + 500


where m = slope = change in y upon change in x
 
    =   rise/run 
    
    
    
    
    
slope   , tangent , colinear , linear, regression , calculus   etc 



To find the salary of the person we are taking into consideration their years of exp, age, desigation, Qualification etc 


so for this 

Target variable = salary ==  Bo + b1x + b2x2 + ....
independent variable  = exp, age, Qualification, designation etc ..

 = b0 + b1(exp) + b2(age) + b3(Quali) + ... 
 
 
 
polynomial equations :

y = mx + c      ------------------> linear   with degree 1 
y = ax^2 + bx =c   ---------------> Quadratic   -- 2
y = ax^3 +bx^2 +cx +d   ----------> cubic  -- 3



Quadratic equations :

Shape of the Quadratic Equtions --- > Always it gives us like parabola shape ...


y = ax^2 + bx + c

i) if a > 0 ===>  upper parabola ==>  y = 2x^2 + 3x +5

ii) if a < 0 ==>  down parabola ==>  y = -3x^2 + 5x + 6



Monotonic 
Global Min & Global Max
Local Min & Local Max
First Derivative
Second Derivative
Critical Points 




if ithe curve is increases or decreses its called Monotonic 

domain is on x axis    -- like inputs 
range is on y axis   --- like outputs 


Global max means for any value that we have in the domain what is maximum value we can get in range is called as global maximum ..

Maximum ever till now - Global Max
Maximum only for a certain period - Local Max

The highest of all local maximum is the Global Maximum, lowest of all local min is global min?
Example...Maximum marks in class and maximum marks in a particular section in a class

for a given data global max & min it only single point, but for local max & min can be many ......â€¦..... [example of voice frequency , and draw sin wave and locate local, global ]



1. Consider the following equation and determine whether there global min, max exist or not 

1. y = -3x^2 + 5x + 3

--> we will get down word parabola -- so will get max point -- > so we will get global max 


2. y = -2x +c 

--> linear eqation so no min , max , or global max , min 

3. y = 5x^2 -3x -2

--> a> 0 means upper side parabola --> so we will get global minimum 




so for above equations we want to find global max, min and their comes calculus ..

Derivatives 
when we want to understand how the change in 1 variable is impacting the change in another variable we can use the concept of derivatives 

y = x^5 
dy/dx = 5x^4

formula : if y = x^n , dy/dx =  n * x^n-1

if y = 3x^4
dy/dx = 12x^3

for y = k , ==> dy/dx = 0

y = K ==>  3x^0  ==> dy/dx = 3 . 0 . x ^ 0-1  ==> 0 


y =x => dy/dx = 1

y = 5x^6 -3x + 7 ==> dy/dx =  30x^5 -3

Objective function 
y = x^2 -5x + 2 --->   find global min 

usually the min and max values at the points where the graph changes the direction either from increasing to decresing or  decresing to increasing ..  In this case we have to achieve the global min that means we have to find the value of x that given us the global min for y ..

1. dy/dx = 2x -5

2. 
and at tengent or critical points the slope = 0 
dy/dx =0 

2x -5 = 0 
x = 5/2    --> critical points ..


3. d^2y/dx^2  = d(2x -5)/dx = 2  > 0   (when we have higher polynomials we dont know about graphs so we have to go for second derivative to fine global min, max ..)

IMP ...

    -> if the second derivative value is positive for the critical calues of X then the curve will have global min at that point.
    -> if the second derivatives is negative for the critical values of X then the curve will have global max.
    
    
    
    global min y value == (5/2)^2 - 5(5/2) + 6 = -1/4
    
   Global min = (5/2,-1/4)
   
 
-->    At x =5/2, the curve is having a global min and the value of global min is -1/4



y = -5x^2 + 6x -2 
1. dy/dx =  -10x + 6
2. x = 6/10 = 3/5
3. d2y/dx = -10   < 0   -- global max
y = -5(6/10)^2 + 6(6/10) -2 == -5*36/100 + 36/10 -2 = -1.8 + 3.6 -2 = -0.2
4. global max = (3/5,-0.2)





-------------

There is a rectangular field with a perimeter of 24 ft. Now find the dimensions of the field that can maximize the area of the rectangle ..



P = 2(l+w)
24 = 2(x+y)

x+y = 12

y = 12 -x 

dy/dx = -1

Area = l*w
     = x* (12-x)
A = 12x - x^2
-----------------so objective function => max area => Max (l,w)


dy/dx = 12-2x  
0 = 12 - 2x => x = 6

d^2y/dx^2 = -2    ------>   global max 

y = 12*6 -6^2
  = 72 - 36
  = 36
  
  
  
  
What is the domain of a Quadratic curve   -->   [-infinity, +infiny]
what is the range of a quadratic curve .. -->   [global min, infinity]  or [-infinity, global max]


* check domain and range in details from google.



-->  A rancher wants to build a rectangular pen, using one side of her barn for one side of the
pen, and using 100m of fencing for the other three sides. What are the dimensions of the
pen built this way that has the largest area?


l+2w = 100
l = 100 - 2w 

Area =  l * w
 = (100-2w) * w 
 A = 100w - 2w^2
